#. TRANSLATORS: The help text for Star Traders is marked up using a
#. custom mark-up format NOT used anywhere else in the source code.
#.
#. Each string is a single page of text that is displayed in an area 76
#. columns wide by 16 lines high.  Each line is delimited by "\n".  NO
#. word-wrapping is performed: you must place the "\n" characters in the
#. appropriate place.  Ideally, each line within the string should be
#. also (manually) space-justified or centred.  TAB characters and other
#. control codes must NOT be used.  If a string starts with "@" as the
#. very first character, that string is ignored (as are all strings
#. following): this allows a variable number of help text pages (from
#. one to ten).  Multibyte strings are handled correctly (even those
#. requiring shift sequences!).
#.
#. The ASCII circumflex accent character "^" switches to a different
#. character rendition (also called attributes), depending on the
#. character following the "^":
#.
#. ^^ - Print the circumflex accent (ASCII code U+005E)
#. ^N - Switch to using the normal character rendition
#. ^B - Switch to using the bold character rendition
#. ^H - Switch to using the highlight character rendition
#. ^K - Switch to using the keycode character rendition (such as used for "<CTRL><C>")
#. ^e - Switch to using the character rendition used for empty space
#. ^o - Switch to using the character rendition used for outposts
#. ^s - Switch to using the character rendition used for stars
#. ^c - Switch to using the character rendition used for companies
#. ^k - Switch to using the character rendition used for keyboard choices on the galaxy map
#.
#. The help text parsing routines also understand the following "value
#. escapes" introduced by the ASCII tilde character "~"; these act like
#. "%" conversion specifiers in printf():
#.
#. ~~       - Print the tilde character (ASCII code U+007E) [*]
#. ~x       - Print the width of the galaxy map (MAX_X) [**]
#. ~y       - Print the height of the galaxy map (MAX_Y) [**]
#. ~m       - Print the number of moves available (NUMBER_MOVES) [**]
#. ~c       - Print the maximum number of companies that can be formed (MAX_COMPANIES) [*]
#. ~t       - Print the default number of turns in the game (DEFAULT_MAX_TURN) [**]
#. ~1 to ~9 - Print the keycode for the N-th choice of move [***]
#. ~M       - Print the keycode for the last choice of move [***]
#. ~A to ~H - Print the character used to represent the company on the galaxy map [***]
#. ~.       - Print the character used to represent empty space on the map [***]
#. ~+       - Print the character used to represent outposts on the map [***]
#. ~*       - Print the character used to represent stars on the map [***]
#.
#. [*]   Takes one character space (column space) in the output
#. [**]  Takes two column spaces in the output
#. [***] Takes one or two column spaces in the output, depending on the
#. appropriate strings in the current PO file.
#.
#. Note that all keycodes and map representation characters use locale-
#. specific characters; double-width characters ARE supported.  Note
#. also that the tilde value escapes do NOT change the current character
#. rendition: a circumflex accent escape is needed for that.  For
#. example, to display the first choice of move as it would be shown on
#. the galaxy map, use something like "^k~1^N" (a six-character sequence
#. that would translate to just one character (or maybe two) in the
#. output text).
#.
#. Formatting the help text is probably the most complicated and tedious
#. part of translating Star Traders.  The author and maintainer of this
#. game is more than happy to help you with this task: if you are able
#. to provide a translation, even if it is not formatted correctly, the
#. maintainer will perform the necessary adjustments for word-wrapping
#. and justification.  In addition, remember that you have up to 10
#. pages in which to display your help text: the translation does not
#. need to correspond exactly to the original text.  This text will not
#. be changing any time soon!
#.
